                        I am Jules Leo Reserva. I live in the Philippines and I aspire to be a software engineer.
                        At a very young age, I was already interested with computers. I used to play video games
                        a lot back then, most notably a game called 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>.
                    </div>

                    <div class="text">
                        In the game Minecraft, I've always loved being the guy in the friend group who've
                        always found a way to efficiently managed redstone automation systems and tweaked 
                        on command blocks a little more often. Thus, over time it has developed into a hobby
                        and skill. And soon thereafter, I've realized that what I've been doing inside of Minecraft
                        had the same concept in Computer Science & Programming.

                        It was back in the year 2020, during the coronavirus outbreak, that I've found the
                        Computer Science course called 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50x</a>. 
                        At first, I was hesitant in taking on the course since I was still in high school and my
                        schedule was already hectic. Later on, I soon got the courage and the curiosity to take 
                        the course head first since I didn't really know much about programming.

                        Now, I am currently a 2nd-year college student at Caraga Student University studying computer science.
                        and have I have developed the discipline to always discover new ways to learn about programming, and 
                        hone my skills in self-studying computer science related courses, videos, new programming languages,
                        etc.
